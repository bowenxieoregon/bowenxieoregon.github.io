This post documents my journey through **Stanford CS336: Language Models from Scratch** — specifically Assignment 1, where we implement core components of a language model.

## Overview

CS336 is Stanford's deep dive into building large language models from first principles. Assignment 1 focuses on:

- Tokenization (BPE implementation)
- Transformer architecture components
- Training loop fundamentals

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)

*Coming soon...*

### 2. Attention Mechanism

*Coming soon...*

### 3. Training Considerations

*Coming soon...*

## Implementation Highlights

```python
# Code snippets coming soon...
```

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

*Coming soon...*
